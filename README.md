# npb-198-final-project
This is my final project for NPB 198 (Neural Networks and Machine Learning in Biology), which I took at UC Davis during 
Winter Quarter 2022. I set out to replicate a simple connectionist model of semantic memory put forth by McClelland and 
Rogers in 2003 (described here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1076). I created my own datasets to train my network on, 
and I made graphs of the results I got after testing. These graphs, as well as the network's code, are included within the Jupyter notebooks for each of the datasets' results.
