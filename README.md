# Neural Network Model of Semantic Memory
Hi there! This is a neural network model I created for my final project in NPB 198, 
during Winter Quarter 2022.
I set out to replicate the semantic memory model described in an article by McClelland and Rogers in 2003 
(https://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/McCRogers03.pdf).
For this project, I created my own dataset to train my network on, as opposed to using the one described in the article. I then created charts depicting the network's representation of the data at various points during the training process, following the example of McClelland and Rogers.
The source code and graphs are all included within a Jupyter notebook, and the dataset is available for reference as well.
